Getting started
---------------

To get started with Android/Crdroid/GazaOS, you'll need to get familiar with [Source Control Tools](https://source.android.com/setup/develop).

### Spinning up the environment
--------------
```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akhilnarang/scripts/refs/heads/master/setup/android_build_env.sh)
```

Start Syncing
---------------
To start syncing, create a directory and move in that directoery with the command below.
```bash
mkdir GazaOS && cd GazaOS
```

To initialize your local repository using the aospb trees, use a command like this:
```bash
repo init -u https://github.com/GazaOS/android.git -b 15.0 --git-lfs
```
Alternatively in case you have limited network/disk space resources:
```bash
repo init -u https://github.com/GazaOS/android.git -b 15.2 --git-lfs --depth=1
```
Then to sync up:
```bash
# The -j# option specifies the number of concurrent download threads to run.
# Default sync thread count is set as 8
# In case of sync errors, you may need to adjust this value as per you need

repo sync --force-sync --no-clone-bundle --no-tags
```

```bash
source build/envsetup.sh
```
Use the below command to perform lunch action, replace *$device_codename* as required for your device. 

```bash
